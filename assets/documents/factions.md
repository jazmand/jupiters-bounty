- **Life support baseline**: CO₂ scrubbing to O₂; extensive polar ice mining; sealed agriculture in vaulted glass‑and‑regolith conservatories.
- **Economy (primary sectors)**: Precision glass/optics, ceramics, textiles, medical devices, agritech (controlled‑environment agriculture), survey and cartography.
- **Key inputs/resources**: Polar water ice, regolith silicates, imported steels and electronics, limited trade volatiles from Ganymede.
- **Principal exports**: Scientific instruments, optics, high‑reliability medical kits, fine ceramics, map data; boutique cultural goods for prestige trade.
- **Trade posture**: Cautiously open; relies on reputation for craftsmanship; avoids dependence on American heavy industry.
- **Flavor notes**: Formal etiquette, heraldry, and archival arts prized; royal broadcasts set tone.

## New Martian Combine (South) — American
- **Demonym**: Combiners, Southpolers (colloquial)
- **Founding evac (1936)**: ~7,000
- **Population (2013)**: ~36,000
- **Governance/ideology**: Semi‑fascistic industrial corporatism; party‑aligned combines run production, security unions enforce order; strong military‑industrial culture.
- **Territory**: Southern polar uplands and adjoining highlands; vast factory‑arcologies hugging logistics corridors.
- **Life support baseline**: CO₂ scrubbing and Sabatier reactors (CH₄/O₂); deep‑shaft ice extraction; industrial‑scale greenhouse blocks.
- **Economy (primary sectors)**: Heavy fabrication (pressure vessels, trusses), machine tools, standardized habitat modules, mining equipment, propellant plants (methane/oxygen), bulk ceramics and alloys.
- **Key inputs/resources**: Ice and CO₂, imported specialty polymers and lubricants, occasional water and oxygen from Ganymede shipments.
- **Principal exports**: Modular habitats, drills and rover frames, standardized life‑support skids, bulk propellants for inner‑system logistics.
- **Trade posture**: Aggressively mercantile; undercuts rivals via scale; leverages credit‑for‑hardware deals; constant cold‑war posture toward the Britannic Mars.
- **Flavor notes**: Company‑town regimentation; propaganda of productivity; parades of new machines along pressurized boulevards.

## Ganymede Entente — Franco‑German
- **Demonym**: Ganymedians,
- **Founding evac (1936)**: ~4,000
- **Population (2013)**: ~14,000
- **Governance/ideology**: Social‑market technocracy; consensus planning with cooperative ownership.
- **Territory**: Ice‑rich belts of Ganymede; orbital infrastructure centered on the new Ganymede Station.
- **Life support baseline**: Direct access to water and oxygen (atmospheric/ice extraction per local methods); robust closed‑loop recycling.
- **Economy (primary sectors)**: Cryogenics and fuel logistics, water/oxygen refining, docking/repair yards.
- **Key inputs/resources**: Abundant water and oxygen; metals from limited mining and traded imports; steady skilled labor from compact guilds.
- **Principal exports**: LH₂/LOX and water contracts, life‑support consumables.
- **Trade posture**: Neutral broker and hub; mediates Mars trade and enables long‑range itineraries; reputation for fair weights and safe port.
- **Flavor notes**: Entente badges, bilingual signage (FR/DE), shift bells and cooperative guild halls.

## Titan Soviet Directorate — Soviet
- **Demonym**: Titanians, TiSovs (colloquial)
- **Founding evac (1936)**: ~3,500
- **Population (2013)**: ~8,000
- **Governance/ideology**: Isolationist technocracy; closed scientific directorates and security apparat; doctrine of self‑reliance and information control.
- **Territory**: Subsurface habitats beneath Titan’s dunes; aerostat relays in the dense atmosphere; logistics links rumored to outer Saturnian moons.
- **Life support baseline**: Methods opaque; widely assumed to import or harvest water/oxygen via Saturnian system sorties; extensive hydrocarbon processing.
- **Economy (primary sectors)**: Organics and polymers from methane/ethane feedstocks, cryogenic engineering, cold‑environment materials, sealed electronics.
- **Key inputs/resources**: Titan hydrocarbons, atmospheric nitrogen; trace metals via uncertain sources; occasional clandestine imports through intermediaries.
- **Principal exports**: Specialty polymers and nitrile composites, cryo‑rated seals and gaskets, limited methane shipments; rare bespoke components.
- **Trade posture**: Minimal contact; trades via cut‑outs at neutral ports (often Ganymede); price‑insensitive when strategic.
- **Flavor notes**: Ghost signals in the static; austere, ice‑frosted insignia; technical papers with redacted passages.

## Selenian Free Guild — Chinese
- **Demonym**: Selenians;
- **Founding evac (1936)**: ~2,500 (mixed origins, including late private flights)
- **Population (2013)**: ~9,000
- **Governance/ideology**: Loose confederation of trading houses; charters and arbitration codes substitute for state authority.
- **Territory**: Cavern and lava‑tube settlements near mare edges; regolith‑shielded depots at key peaks of eternal light.
- **Life support baseline**: Water/oxygen from trade; austere recycling.
- **Economy (primary sectors)**: Brokerage, salvage, small‑batch precision parts, prospecting intel, courier services.
- **Key inputs/resources**: Steady trickle of traded components.
- **Principal exports**: Brokerage services, route intel, bespoke components, small courier payloads; occasional rare‑ore lots.

### System‑wide context
- The two Martian powers are the largest economies by scale, locked in a cold war across opposite poles.
- Ganymede thrives as the logistics linchpin for water, oxygen, and fuel.
- Titan remains the wild card: small, secretive, and technically formidable in narrow domains.
